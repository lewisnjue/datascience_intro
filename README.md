# DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON 

## WHAT IS DATA ANALYSIS 

a process of inspectng , cleansing , transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information , informing conclusion and supporting decision making . 

lets look at this definision a little bit more , the first step is gathering data , cleaning it and tranforming it 
and this process is done with somethng like pandas which we will look at it 

modeling data means adopting data of real life to information system 
using inferencial statistics to see if any partern exist in the data here we are going to be using the statistical analysis of pandas and matplotlib for visualization 
after this we are going to try to see and discover useful information from the data we have 
here we are tryig to tranform data into information 

## DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS 

### PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 
- python 
- julia 
- R
### AUTO-MANAGED CLOSED TOOLS 
- qlink 
- tableau 
- looker 
- zoho analytics 

lets discuss the main advantance and disadvantage of them 
the auto-managed closed tools are : 
- closed source 
- expensive 
- limited 
- easy to learn 

on the other hand the programming lanaguages are : 
- open source 
- free ( or very cheap )
- extremely powerful 
- steep learing curve 

lets look at the data analysis standard way of doing it 

- data extraction 
    - sql 
    - scrapping
    - file formates 
        - csv 
        - json 
        - xml 
    - consulting apis
    - buying data 
    - distrubted databases 

lets look at the data cleaning part 

- missing values and empty data 
- data imputation 
- incorrect types 
- incorrect or invalid values 
- outiers and non relevant data 
- statistical sanitization 

with your data cleaned comes the data wrangling 

- hierarchical data 
- handling categorical data 
- reshaping and tranforming structres 
- indexing data for quick access 
- merging , combining and joing data 

the next step is the analysis part here : 

- exploration 
- building statistical models 
- visualization and representations 
- correlation vs causation analysis 
- hypothesis testing 
- statistical analysis 
- reporting 


finaly its time to take action 

- building machine learning models 
- feature engineering 
- moving ML into production 
- building ETL pipelines 
- live dashboeards and reporting 
- desion making and real life tests 

in real life this process is not linear we are jumping from one step to another , that is very important 

## WHAT IS THE DIFFRENCES BETWEEN DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA SCIENCE 

 the diffrences between this two is not that clear the one diffrence is that the data science have more math skills and they can apply these skills in machine learning andother processes 

to the data analysis part the data analysis have more good communication skills and able to make good reports 

lets look at python and data ecosystem ;

## THE LIBRARIES WE USE ... 
- PANDAS : the cornerstone of our data analysis job in python 
- MATPLOTLIB :  the  foundational library for visualizations. other libraries well use will built on top of matplotlib . 
- NUMPY : the numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in python 
- SEABORN : a statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib . 
- STATSMODLES :  a library many advanced statical funtions  
- SCIPY :  advanced sciencitific computing , including functions for optimization, linear algebr , image processing and much more . 
- SCIKIT-LEARN : the most popular machine learning library for python ( not deep learning )



## INTOR TO JUPYTER NOTEBOOK 

the jupter notebook is an open source application that allows you to create and share documentants that contanin live code . equations, vusualization and narrative text. uses include data clearning andtranformation , numerical simulation , statistical modeling , data visualization , machine learning and much more . 

jupyterlab is a web based interactive development enviroment for jupyter notbooks, code and date , jupyter lab is configure and arrange the user interace to support a wide range of workflows in data sciencde , scietific copuitind and machine learning , jupyter lab is etensiible and modular write plugins that add new components and interate with existing ones
