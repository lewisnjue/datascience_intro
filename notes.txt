first what is the need of data sciece 
there are manyreason why we need data science some are:
. to handle and analyze extremely large datasets / dat flow
. faster and beter decision making
. no predictions 
. reduce product cost
. gain business insights 
. build intelligence and ability in machines 
most of today is untracted and faster created every day 
and this becomes complex
to use this data we use data science and gain insights from 
those data 
we used data warehouse but now we use hadoop
okay what is data science: data science known as data driven 
science makes uses of scientific methods processes algoritms
and systems to extract knowledge or insights with the goal
to discover hidden patterns from the daw data 
there are diffrent programming language but python is the one
that stand one this is because:
 .it is simple
 . fit for many platforms
 . it is high level and interpreted language(script language)
 . perform data manipulation ,analysis and visualizaion
 . powerful libraries for machine learning applicaions and other
scientific computaions
some skill set include : statistics, programming language,
data extraion and processing, data wrangiling and exploration,
machine learning , big data processing frameworkds , data visualizaion
